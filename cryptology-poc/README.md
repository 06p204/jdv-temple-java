### Encoding

The purpose of encoding is to transform data so that it can be properly (and safely) consumed by a different type of system, 
e.g. binary data being sent over email, or viewing special characters on a web page. 
The goal is not to keep information secret, but rather to ensure that itâ€™s able to be properly consumed.

**Encoding transforms data into another format using a scheme that is publicly available so that it can easily be reversed. 
It does not require a key as the only thing required to decode it is the algorithm that was used to encode it.**

#### Examples of algorithms:

* ASCII
* Unicode
* URL Encoding
* Base64
