## Encoding

Encoding transforms data into another format using a scheme that is **publicly available** so that it can easily be reversed.

Encoding is two-way function. You can encode and decode data without any keys (you only need to now character table).

#### Examples of algorithms:

* ASCII
* Unicode
* URL Encoding
* Base64

## Encryption

Encryption is the process of transforming data using an algorithm (called **cipher**) to make it unreadable to anyone except those who knows the secret **key**.

Encryption is two-way function. You can encrypt and decrypt data (but you need **key** and know **encryption algorithm** which was used to decrypt data correctly).

### Symmetric Encryption
 
In symmetric encryption the same key is used for both encryption and decryption.

#### Examples of algorithms:

* AES
* Blowfish
* DES
* RC2

### Asymmetric Encryption
 
Asymmetric encryption is a strong encryption technique which uses a **key pair**.
The key pair consists  of a **public key** and a **private key**. 
Data or message encrypted using the private key can **only** be decrypted using the public key.

#### Examples of algorithms:

* RSA
* Diffie-Hellman
* ECC
* ElGamal

## Hashing

Hashing is the process of storing the text password as encrypted with some hash one-way function (**Message Digest**) sequence of characters.

**Storing the text password with hashing is most dangerous thing for application security today.**

#### Examples of digests:

* MD5 (is considered broken)
* SHA
    - SHA-1 (160-bit output hash algorithm)
    - SHA-2 (256-bit, 384-bit, 512-bit hash algorithms)
* BCrypt
* SCrypt

Even SHA hashed secure passwords are able to be cracked with todayâ€™s fast hardwares. 
To beat that, you will need algorithms which can make the brute force attacks slower and minimize the impact. 
Such algorithms are BCrypt and SCrypt.
